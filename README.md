## GH-PAGES ASDF System Details

* Description: A helper to update gh-pages branch with documentation on your library.
* Licence: Unlicense
* Author: Alexander Artemenko
* Homepage: [https://40ants.com/gh-pages/][4dde]
* Source control: [GIT][27aa]
* Depends on: [log4cl][7f8b]

This utility is successor of [https://github.com/40ants/update-gh-pages][9170]. Fully rewritten to be more maintainable and modular.

It can be used as a standalone script or from the Common Lisp system.

## How does it work

This script can be run inside a `CI` pipeline to upload `HTML` documentation into a separate
git branch, used to serve static site on GitHub Pages. Also, you can run it manually
on localhost.

The script does a few steps:

* it determines in which environment it is running
* what is the proper upstream Git repositor
* then set up a `gh-pages` branch
* uploads content of the given directory, as the content of the `gh-pages` branch.

## CI Support

Currently [`gh-pages`][8a8b] supports following `CI` systems:

* GitHub Actions
* Travis (not tested yet)

Also, you can run it from you own machine.

To use the utility on `CI`, make sure there is a github token in the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
environment variable. Don't commit it into the repository, usually `CI` provides
a way to set such secrets in a secure way. Inside GitHub actions this token should
be already defined.

To learn, how to add support for other `CI` systems, read
[protocol.lisp][af0e]
and [github.lisp][893a] as the
reference implementation.

## Untitled

To install [`gh-pages`][8a8b], use `Roswell`:

```
ros install 40ants/gh-pages
```
After this command, an executable file `~/.roswell/bin/gh-pages` will be created.

Usage: gh-pages [-h] [OPTIONS] PATH...

  -h, --help                  Show help on this program.
  -b, --branch=STR            A branch to push to (default: gh-pages)
                              Default: gh-pages
```
In most cases you have to specify a path to a directory containing `HTML` docs
and script will do the rest.
