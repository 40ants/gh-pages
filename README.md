# GH-PAGES is utility to update your site from CI

## Table of Contents


###### \[in package DOCS with nicknames DOCS/INDEX\]
This utility is successor of <https://github.com/40ants/update-gh-pages>. Fully rewritten to be more maintainable and modular.

It can be used as a standalone script or from the Common Lisp system.

Currently `GH-PAGES` supports following CI systems:

- GitHub Actions

- Travis (not tested yet)

Also, you can run it from you own machine.

To use the utility on CI, make sure there is a github token in the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
environment variable. Don't commit it into the repository, usually CI provides
a way to set such secrets in a secure way.
