## GH-PAGES ASDF System Details

* Description: A helper to update gh-pages branch with documentation on your library.

* Licence: Unlicense

* Author: Alexander Artemenko

* Homepage: [https://40ants.com/gh-pages/][4dde]

* Source control: [GIT][27aa]

This utility is successor of [https://github.com/40ants/update-gh-pages][9170]. Fully rewritten to be more maintainable and modular.

It can be used as a standalone script or from the Common Lisp system.

Currently [`gh-pages`][8a8b] supports following `CI` systems:

* GitHub Actions

* Travis (not tested yet)

Also, you can run it from you own machine.

To use the utility on `CI`, make sure there is a github token in the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
environment variable. Don't commit it into the repository, usually `CI` provides
a way to set such secrets in a secure way.
